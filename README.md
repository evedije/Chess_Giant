# Chess Giant

## Background
Jim Sotheby, a successful entrepreneur and master chess player, plans to launch a platform called "Chess Giants" for elite chess players with a rating of 2200 or higher. The site will require members to pay $1500 annual membership fee. To become a member, players must go through an approval process by the administrator until an automated integration with US Chess (www.uschess.org) is developed later.

The site will enable members to:

* Play chess with other members online.
* Challenge other members via email.
* View the top 10 players and challenge them to a game.
* Post and discuss game strategies and results, with moderation by administrator for content management.

## Project Detail
* Stakeholder interview

  Through an interview with Jim, we gained a better understanding of the business and gathered requirements which we later used to define scopes of the project.

  Some of the questions asked during the initial stakeholder interview includes

  ** What are you trying to achieve by building Chess Giants?

  ** How do you envision your players using your website? What can players do and cannot do?

  ** How much budget do we have to build this system?

  ** How does your schedule look like for us to go over the document of the process?

* Requirement Gathering

  Through the stakeholder interview, we gathered information about which later we would translate these business needs into project's scopes and defined functional and non-functional requirements.

* Designs:
  ** Activity Diagram,
  ** Data Model, and Wireframes
