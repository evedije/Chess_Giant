# Chess Giant
## Background
Jim Sotheby, a successful entrepreneur and master chess player, plans to launch a website called "Chess Giants" for elite chess players with a rating of 2200 or higher. The site will require a $1500 annual membership fee, and membership approval will be manual unless an automated integration with US Chess (www.uschess.org) can be developed later.

The website will enable members to:

* Play chess with other members online.
* Challenge other members via email.
* View a leaderboard of the top 10 players.
* Post and discuss game strategies, with moderation features for content management.

Jim is budgeting $500,000 for the project but lacks IT experience and will need guidance from the selected IT firm. The site will use ChessMaster software for gameplay, but integration expertise is currently lacking within the team. Jimâ€™s travel schedule may limit his availability for meetings during development.
